I was watching the DodgersMarlins game yesterday and a couple ofthings impressed me.First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami it had a summeratmosphere in early spring for baseball. In comparison Wrigley Fieldin early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy andbundled up fans.
I personally will never forget Mike Schmidts home run against theExpos in  that decided the NL East. It was also his career highth.Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the ALCS. The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox  strike away fromthe pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run.
This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary. VERYscary Dont get me wrong Im a Phillies fan but as late as lastyear they looked helpless.
