I was watching the DodgersMarlins game yesterday and a couple ofthings impressed me.First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami it had a summeratmosphere in early spring for baseball. In comparison Wrigley Fieldin early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy andbundled up fans.
I personally will never forget Mike Schmidts home run against theExpos in 1980 that decided the NL East. It was also his career high48th.Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the1986 ALCS. The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox 1 strike away fromthe pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run.
This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary. VERYscary Dont get me wrong Im a Phillies fan but as late as lastyear they looked helpless.
